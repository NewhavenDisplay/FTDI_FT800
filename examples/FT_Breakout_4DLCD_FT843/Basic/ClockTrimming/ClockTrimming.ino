/*
The following steps provide a detailed programming sequence to trim the internal clock:

1. After a hardware reset (power on or toggling PD_N pin), the FT800/FT801 enters STANDBY mode.  The internal relaxation oscillator clock is selected as the clock source of the PLL.  Both the internal clock and the PLL are turned on, but the main clock to the core logic is turned off.

2. Set the chip to ACTIVE mode by doing a dummy read operation through host interface (SPI or I2C).

3. Measure the current clock frequency
	a. Read REG_CLOCK as T0
	b. Delay 1us (1 nano second)
	c. Read REG_CLOCK as t1
	d. Calculate the clock frequency f = (t1-t0) / 1us

4. If the measured frequency f is less than 48MHz - 3%, increase the REG_TRIM register by 1
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the measured frequency is within 48MHz +/- 3%, or the REG_TRIM already reaches the maximum value of 31 (which is unlikely since the trimming range is defined to be able to tune the clock to the target)
